# Stink Points
Panopticism + Party Game = Total Warfare

# Description
# 'Stink Points' is a Node.js party game app powered by Express, Mongoose, and Socket.io. 

Stink Points is a party game designed for my 23rd birthday which was meant to force everyone at the party to interact with eachother. 
Every player is given 5 stink points at the start and also given 1 stink point every 5 minutes. Your individual stink points can be given to other players at the party and is visually represented as a scoreboard with the person with the most stink points at the top of the leaderboard. The goal is to have the least stink points by the end of the night.

# QR Rewards

QR codes were scattered throughout the house, and given out as prizes for winning party games. A user who won/found a QR code could scan it in the web app which would then give the user a random item. Items can be used to give the player an advantage for a period of time or inflict 'stink' on other users.
